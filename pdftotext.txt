Avanade Certifications 
How To Apply Your 100% Discounted Voucher Code Quick Reference Guide  

Voucher Codes 

Certifications are an integral part of Avanade and using our exam vouchers provides an easy way to take exams for free.  

Avanade’s consultants have earned over 60,000 Microsoft certifications while winning the Microsoft Partner of the year 17 

times. Our consultants have obtained the latest industry and security certifications from other cloud service providers such as 

Microsoft, Hadoop, Sitecore, Adobe. This document is meant to serve as a quick reference guide for applying your voucher 

code at Pearson VUE   

Applying your Voucher Code at Pearson VUE 

The following steps will show you how to schedule your Microsoft certification exam with your 100% discounted voucher code. 

After March 1, 2023, Avanade no longer uses the Microsoft ESI program to schedule free exam. After March 1, the ESI program 

will only list a 50% off discount so Avanade will use the following procedure and apply a voucher code received from the 

Voucher Management team.  

1.  Navigate to the Microsoft LxP (Learner Experience Portal) - https://esi.microsoft.com/ and login using your 

Avanade email. Select the Microsoft Certifications tile to begin scheduling your exam. You can also schedule your

Avanade Certifications 
How To Apply Your 100% Discounted Voucher Code Quick Reference Guide  

Voucher Codes 

Certifications are an integral part of Avanade and using our exam vouchers provides an easy way to take exams for free.  

Avanade’s consultants have earned over 60,000 Microsoft certifications while winning the Microsoft Partner of the year 17 

times. Our consultants have obtained the latest industry and security certifications from other cloud service providers such as 

Microsoft, Hadoop, Sitecore, Adobe. This document is meant to serve as a quick reference guide for applying your voucher 

code at Pearson VUE   

Applying your Voucher Code at Pearson VUE 

The following steps will show you how to schedule your Microsoft certification exam with your 100% discounted voucher code. 

After March 1, 2023, Avanade no longer uses the Microsoft ESI program to schedule free exam. After March 1, the ESI program 

will only list a 50% off discount so Avanade will use the following procedure and apply a voucher code received from the 

Voucher Management team.  

1.  Navigate to the Microsoft LxP (Learner Experience Portal) - https://esi.microsoft.com/ and login using your 

Avanade email. Select the Microsoft Certifications tile to begin scheduling your exam. You can also schedule your 

exam directly from the Microsoft Learn exam page.

Avanade Certifications 
How To Apply Your 100% Discounted Voucher Code Quick Reference Guide  

Voucher Codes 

Certifications are an integral part of Avanade and using our exam vouchers provides an easy way to take exams for free.  

Avanade’s consultants have earned over 60,000 Microsoft certifications while winning the Microsoft Partner of the year 17 

times. Our consultants have obtained the latest industry and security certifications from other cloud service providers such as 

Microsoft, Hadoop, Sitecore, Adobe. This document is meant to serve as a quick reference guide for applying your voucher 

code at Pearson VUE   

Applying your Voucher Code at Pearson VUE 

The following steps will show you how to schedule your Microsoft certification exam with your 100% discounted voucher code. 

After March 1, 2023, Avanade no longer uses the Microsoft ESI program to schedule free exam. After March 1, the ESI program 

will only list a 50% off discount so Avanade will use the following procedure and apply a voucher code received from the 

Voucher Management team.  

1.  Navigate to the Microsoft LxP (Learner Experience Portal) - https://esi.microsoft.com/ and login using your 

Avanade email. Select the Microsoft Certifications tile to begin scheduling your exam. You can also schedule your 

exam directly from the Microsoft Learn exam page.

Applying your Voucher Code at Pearson VUE 

The following steps will show you how to schedule your Microsoft certification exam with your 100% discounted voucher code. 

After March 1, 2023, Avanade no longer uses the Microsoft ESI program to schedule free exam. After March 1, the ESI program 

will only list a 50% off discount so Avanade will use the following procedure and apply a voucher code received from the 

Voucher Management team.

Avanade email. Select the Microsoft Certifications tile to begin scheduling your exam. You can also schedule your

How To Apply Your 100% Discounted Voucher Code Quick Reference Guide  

Voucher Codes 

Certifications are an integral part of Avanade and using our exam vouchers provides an easy way to take exams for free.  

Avanade’s consultants have earned over 60,000 Microsoft certifications while winning the Microsoft Partner of the year 17
